Aplication has X classes and uses functions for:
<ul>
<li> occupancy control //if measuring signal is 1 </li>
<li> door safety control //if all doors lock checks are 1 </li>
<li> functionality control //if system indication is 1 </li>
<li> opening the door on floor where its stops </li>
<li> release all doors lock, when elevator is not occupied </li>
<li> change direction allowed, if the top floor of direction is reached </li>
<li> stopping the elevator </li>

House with elevator has 4 floor. //I hope, that I understood correctly, that not elevator has 4 floors (as described in the assignment) ;-)
, there are two basic panels for manipulating (external and internal)
, 
, elevator starts going in direction of the first button pressed
, upon further external calls from the direction of movement, the elevator stops on the floor from which it was called
